Title: Making recommendation on most effective campaigning for WTWY
---

## 

### Problem 

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year and is looking to fill the event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. WTWY contracted my team to make a recommendation that optimizes the effectiveness of the fundraising street team around New York City.   

My team's proposal is a data-driven approach that includes analysis from the following data sources:

- New York Subway (MTA) data on entries and exits at subway stations March - May (months leading up to the Gala in June)
- United States 2010 Census data with 5 year projections for 2015
- Yelp data of restaurants within 3 mile radius of the Empire State Building

### Analysis and Results

Our analysis focused on finding the best location that captures these desirable characteristics:

- High volume of foot traffic to enable large reach while minimizing the commute time of our street team
- High concentration of our targetted demographics so every interaction is more relevant
- Best location to allow for more meaningful conversations between the street team and the general public

We determined the highest volume subway stations using the MTA data. Our analysis suggests the 10 highest volume subway stations are Penn Station (with a whopping 25 million entries and exits daily), Grand Central (22 million), 34th St / Herald Square, 14th St / Union Square as shown below.

However, volume isn't the only factor. Our target demographics is the high income working professional women, because this segment is more likely to support our cause of participation of women in Tech. We want to hone into the most targetted neighborhoods with the highest volumne. We answer this puzzle using the Census data to find a high concenation of high income women. Amongst these top 10 stations identified above, we found below to be the top 5 neighborhoods with the highest % of women and the highest median income.

Finally, to maximize the impact of the street team's efforts, we use Yelp data to identify the most popular restaurants with the longest waits. We believe that high income working professional women are more likely to dine out due to having the disposable income and the lack of time. While people are waiting for their tables outside of restaurants, they are more open to having a more meaningful conversation with our street team. Considering the same top 10 stations, we ranked the top 5 neighborhoods with the most popular restaurants. We found Union Square and Penn Station to be again the winners. At these two stations, the most popular restaurants are listed below.

### Recommendation

For the highest impact of our street team, we recommend our street team to promote at the lines outside or inside of Artichoke Pizza, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Milk Bar, Cafeteria, Morimoto, Amelie.
